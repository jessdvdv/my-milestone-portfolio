         <h1>About Me</h1>
         <br>
         <p>I hail from the Great Pacific Northwest where tech startups reign free and coffee brews on every corner. My dream from a young age was to be part of a creative industry, surrounded by innovators and go-getters. However, my logical, reasoning, spreadsheet loving brain also wanted to have structure and organization. I found myself excelling in logistical positions, but was never truly satisfied. Then I entered the world of code, found my flow and will never looked back.</p>
         <br>
         <p>Web development brings me the joy of both structure and problem solving, which I love so much, and the ability to be creative, all while working within an innovative, boundary pushing industry. Now, I cannot imagine my life without building websites with HTML, making them come to life with CSS and turning designs into beautiful original web pages. I love creating an organized framework and fine tuning details into gorgeous, unique, clean, code.</p>
